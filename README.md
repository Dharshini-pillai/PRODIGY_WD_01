Responsive Landing Page - Prodigy
This project is a clean, multi-section landing page template designed to be fully responsive across all devices (mobile, tablet, and desktop). It serves as a foundation for showcasing a business or product.

The code provided is a base HTML structure and requires accompanying CSS (style.css) for styling and JavaScript (script.js) for interactive features (e.g., sticky navigation, mobile menu toggle, or scroll animations).

üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites
You only need a modern web browser to view this page and a text editor to modify the files.

Installation and Setup
Clone or Download: Download the project files (or copy the HTML provided).

Create Files: Ensure you have three files in the root directory:

index.html (The provided HTML structure)

style.css (For all styling and responsiveness)

script.js (For all interactivity and dynamic features)

Open: Open index.html in your favorite web browser to view the page.

üèóÔ∏è Project Structure
The project is designed with a clear, standard structure:

File Name	Purpose
index.html	The main HTML file containing the document structure, header, navigation, and four content sections (#home, #about, #services, #contact).
style.css	The CSS file for styling, layout, and implementing media queries to ensure responsiveness.
script.js	The JavaScript file used for adding dynamic behaviors (e.g., making the header sticky, implementing a smooth scroll, or creating a mobile navigation menu).

Export to Sheets
‚ú® Features to Implement (using CSS & JS)
The current HTML is built to support the following key features:

HTML Structure
Header: Contains the logo (Prodigy) and the main navigation.

Main Sections: Four distinct sections for clear content organization.

CSS Goals (style.css)
Responsive Design: Use Flexbox and/or CSS Grid for layout and Media Queries for breakpoints to adapt the layout on smaller screens.

Visual Appeal: Apply modern typography, color palettes, and spacing.

Navigation Styling: Style the header to be clean and visually distinct from the main content.

JavaScript Goals (script.js)
Sticky Header: Implement logic to make the <header> element stick to the top of the viewport when the user scrolls down.

Active Navigation: Highlight the currently active link in the navigation bar based on which section is visible in the viewport.

Mobile Menu Toggle: (Requires adding a menu icon/button to the HTML) Implement a function to open and close the main navigation menu on mobile devices.
